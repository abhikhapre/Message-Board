# Message-Board
During my Master's in WIU, for the course of Topics in Computer Graphics, I developed a Message Board as a final Project using PHP and AJAX. Users can log into their profile, can view others profile, can share messages, can edit profile, can do like or unlike messages using AJAX for quick response on the same web page.  Editor : codeanywhere.com Technologies : PHP, html, CSS, JavaScript, phpmyadmin
